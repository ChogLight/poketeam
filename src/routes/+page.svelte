	<p class="text-justify">The following website will allow you to build your own Pokemon team. You will find the build team tool
		in the PokeDex page. There you will be able to add 6 Pokemon to your team and name it as you want to. In the Team Builder page 
		you will check your teams and check your elemental weaknesses and strenghts through a radar chart. You will have 3 possible values 
		in this chart: 0.5, 1, and 2. Each of these represent either the damage taken or made (e.g 0.5 fire taken means half damage taken from fire)
